# Simple Particle Simulation Using PICO-8
A simple particle simulation made with pico-8. Now only includes the explosion effect. Other effects might be achieved by changing serval parameters in the code.
# Installation
Requirement: PICO-8 (obviously)  
Open the .p8 file or the .png with PICO-8!
# Control
Y to change palette  
X to explode!
# Parameters
p_rnd=true ---random position of Explosion  
p_x=64  
p_y=64  
p_num=300 --number of particles created each explosion  
p_r=5	--radius of each particle  
p_vx=2  
p_vy=2  
p_life=1	--life time  
p_plt=1	--palete using (1-5)
